# Some notes of mine useful for dev

Accommodating the need to run on different operating systems was challenging.
The solution was to have a common "core" that was platform agnostic.
To perform I/O, the core would tap into sub-systems specific to the platform
they targeted.
Most of the DOOM code is shared. Only a few files are platform specific.
Since C has no namespaces, prefixes are applied to function names.
I_ stands for "implementation-specific", P_ gameplay, R_ is for renderer and so on.
The beauty of this architecture is that once the platform-specific systems are
written, there is zero overhead to writing code that runs on multiple platforms.
Most of the code goes into the core and the platform-specific code needs not be
touched any more.
Because portability was not an afterthought but an integral part of the
development process, DOOMâ€™s code layering is never violated. This rigorous
design partly explains why DOOM has been ported to so many systems: there is
very little code to write.

Start divig into the code: where the frick is the `main`?
In the case of DOOM there is one entry point per OS and they are all in
implementation-specific (I_*) files. Regardless of the platform, all entry
points converge on the core main function named `D_DoomMain` located in d_main.c.

```c
void D_DoomMain(void) {
    FindResponseFile(); // Search doom . wad , doom1 . wad ...
    IdentifyVersion();  // shareware or registered ?
    V_Init();           // Video system
    M_LoadDefaults();   // Load params from default . cfg
    Z_Init();           // Zone Memory Allocator
    M_Init();           // Menu
    R_Init();           // Renderer
    P_Init();           // gamePlay
    I_Init();           // Implementation dependant
    D_CheckNetGame();
    S_Init();           // sound
    HU_Init();          // HUD
    ST_Init();          // Status bar
    D_DoomLoop();     // never returns
} /* d_main . c */
```

Peeking inside `D_DoomLoop` reveals a standard loop where the machine runs as
fast as possible to update the game simulation according to user input and
A.I., and then generate visual and audio output.

```c
void D_DoomLoop(void)
{
    if (gamevariant == bfgedition &&
        (demorecording || (gameaction == ga_playdemo) || netgame))
    {
        printf(" WARNING: You are playing using one of the Doom Classic\n"
               " IWAD files shipped with the Doom 3: BFG Edition. These are\n"
               " known to be incompatible with the regular IWAD files and\n"
               " may cause demos and network games to get out of sync.\n");
    }

    if (demorecording)
        G_BeginRecording();

    main_loop_started = true;

    I_SetWindowTitle(gamedescription);
    I_GraphicsCheckCommandLine();
    I_SetGrabMouseCallback(D_GrabMouseCallback);
    I_InitGraphics();
    EnableLoadingDisk();

    TryRunTics();

    V_RestoreBuffer();
    R_ExecuteSetViewSize();

    D_StartGameLoop();

    if (testcontrols)
    {
        wipegamestate = gamestate;
    }

    while (1)
    {
        D_RunFrame();
    }
}
```
